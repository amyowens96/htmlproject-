					<h5>
                            <p>Workvivo was founded in early 2017 in Cork, Ireland by John Goulding and Joe Lennon. John
                            and Joe had worked together previously at CoreHR, a leading global HCM software provider,
                            as CEO and CTO respectively.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>From their previous roles, both founders had experience of building great cloud-based
                            software for Enterprise customers leading to hugely successful growth. Both founders also
                            experienced the challenges this growth brings in trying to ensure employee engagement
                            and internal communication is optimised as a company scales. Creating Workvivo was based
                            on a desire of the founders to leverage their experience of building great software to
                            develop a product to meet this challenge. The test for both John and Joe was to build a
                            product they would have loved to have had available to them in their previous senior
                            leadership roles in a growing company.</p>
							<br>
                            <p>Designing the Workvivo product was based on a nice recipe for success &hyphen; the domain
                            knowledge of the founders themselves, lots and lots of research, a passion and ability to
                            design a beautiful and engaging user experience, and the help of some incredible early
                            customers.</p>
							<br>
                            <p>After just over a year researching, building the product, assembling a great team, working
                            with fantastic early customers Workvivo was officially launched on July 9<sup>th</sup>, 2018. The
                            founders have enjoyed the journey to get to market and have taken great pride and
                            satisfaction in the success of the customers that gave the company an early vote of
                            confidence. A year after forming, Workvivo is already being used to engage employees
                            across the UK, USA, Canada, Ireland, Australia, Singapore and China.</p>
